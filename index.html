   <p class="lead">"Emily Qualcosa is the ultimate quench to a thirst the music industry didn't know it had." - Rolling Stones Mag 2021 &copy;
    
    <p>
        "Emily Qualcosa has been songwriting since she was 12 years old. Her thirst for writing music grew exponentially when she heard Kate Bush's 'Keep Running Up That Hill' for the first time in her mother's car on the way to school. Since her latest album <text-decoration>'Chasing Snails'</text-decoration>, her integrity and audacious knack for composing gritty and ethereal melody lines has only given her more agency and dominance in the alt scene. Throughout her education, she indulged in many instruments of all varieties to her parent's simultaneous support and patience."
