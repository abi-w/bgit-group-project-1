   <p class="lead">"Emily Qualcosa is the ultimate quench to a thirst the music industry didn't know it had."
    <p>Rolling Stones Mag 2021 &copy;</p>
    
    <p>
        Emily Qualcosa has been songwriting since she was 12 years old. Her thirst for writing music grew exponentially when she heard Kate Bush's 'Keep Running Up That Hill' for the first time in her mother's car on the way to school. Since her latest album 'The Rise', her integrity and audacious knack for composing gritty and ethereal melody lines has only given her more agency and dominance in the pop scene. Throughout her education, she cherished the guitar lessons that her parent's gifted her during her school years.
      </p>
    <p>
    Winner of the 'Promising New Artist of the Year' for three consecutive years, Emily has consistently enveloped herself into her creative process. Early mornings, long nights, she delves deep into her own experiences and emerges with lyrics that make you wish she could score your own life.</p>
 <p>With an impressive release schedule of four albums a year, it won't be long before the music charts will be dominated by one name:</p>
 <p class="lead">Emily Qualcosa</p>
 <p class="lead">For those who know Emily, this is the start of a bodacious career in the making.</p>
 <p class="lead">For those who don't, your idea of music will be changed for the best.</p>
 <p>'The Rise' is available to stream on all platforms.</p>
